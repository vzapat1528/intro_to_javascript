In events.html,

1. Add a second prompt to the greetUser() function so that it also asks for your age.
   Then have the function write a sentence like "Hello, Jon. I see you are 46 years old."
   to the greeting div.

2. Look at the button with the value="Show secret message". Add an onclick event
   handler to this button so that it calls the function showSecretMessage().

3. Make a button with the text "Giraffe Fact" (or something similar). When clicked,
   the button should cause an interesting fact about your animal to appear in a
   div below the secret message.

4. Make a button that changes the font family for the h1 element. You'll need to
   inspect the HTML to find the id associated with the h1 element. Use the highlight()
   function as an example. You should not edit the CSS.

5. List 5 events that JavaScript can respond to other than onload and onclick.
   (We haven't talked about this, just Google it.)
      1.onmouseover
      2.onchange
      3.oncontextmenu
      4.ondblclick
      5.onerror
