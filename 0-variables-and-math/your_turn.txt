In variables_and_math.html,

1. Change the values of a and b to determine the following values:

	14274 + 2303 = ?
	14274 - 2303 = ?
	14274 * 2303 = ?
	14274 / 2303 = ?


2. What is the value of 2^18? (The ^ operator does not mean exponents in JavaScript.
   Use the Math.pow function instead.)

   years old. He was born in Chicago."


4. Test the following lines and comment on what you observe.

		sum1 = 4 + 8;
		sum2 = "4" + "8";
		sum3 = "4" + 8;

		document.write(sum1);
		document.write(sum2);
		document.write(sum3);


5. Explain the difference between numeric and string variables.
